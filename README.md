# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification
Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from a grayscale dataset. The model is trained and validated on a split dataset, with training and validation metrics visualized to evaluate performance. The code optimizes data loading for faster training and uses standard image classification techniques to achieve high accuracy.

## Features
- Grayscale image classification
- Optimized data pipeline for efficient training
- Training and validation metrics visualization

## Requirements
- Unziping the dataset
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
